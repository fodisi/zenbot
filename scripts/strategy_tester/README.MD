The strategy tester should be executed from the root folder, using the file `strategy_tester.sh`

Results are saved on root/scripts/strategy_tester/results/
Result file names have the following nomenclature: `result_strategy_exchange.pair_{x}days.txt`, where `{x}` will be the period used to simulate the strategy.
